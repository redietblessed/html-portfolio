<h1>The Best Movies according to Someone</h1>

<h2>Someones top three Movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Rush hour 1</h3>
<p>
    “Rush Hour” is our reliable friend, the Wunza Movie, pairing two opposites: Wunza legendary detective from Hong Kong, and wunza 
    Los Angeles cop. And wunza Chinese guy, and wunza black guy. And wunza martial arts expert and wunza wisecracking showboat. Neither 
    wunza original casting idea, but together, they make an entertaining team
</p>

<h3>Rush hour 2</h3>
<p>
    "Rush Hour" (1998) earned untold millions of dollars, inspiring this sequel. The first film was built on a comic relationship
     between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, as odd-couple cops from Hong Kong and Los Angeles. It was funny because hard work went 
     into the screenplay and the stunts. It was not funny because Chris Tucker is not funny whenever he opens his mouth--something he 
     proves abundantly in "Rush Hour 2," where his endless rants are like an anchor around the ankles of the humor.

<h3>Rush hour 3</h3>
<p>
    Curious how Carter is always being hauled in from a punishment gig like traffic detail and being assigned to super-important
    cases that will require him to investigate backstage at the Folies Bergere in Paris, etc. This time, one of Lee's old pals,
    Ambassador Han, has been shot in an assassination attempt in L.A., probably by a Chinese Triad gang, who are getting to be as 
    handy as the Mafia for movie plots. Lee, in town as the ambassador's bodyguard, runs after the shooter in one of those impossible 
    Jackie Chan chase scenes; it used to be we were amazed by his stunts, but these days I find myself even more amazed that he can
    still run that far.
